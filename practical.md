# Core Principles

The hackathon is not a competition, it's an opportunity for open source and free software developers to work together on interesting ideas, projects or collaborations. The goal is to welcome newcomers (and help them to get started) and contributors to the various projets. Code is one aspect of the hackathon but documentation, website, presentation materials, design are also important to open source and free software projects in information security.

# Agenda and Etherpad

As this is a hackathon, there is not a strict agenda to avoid interrupting the work on specific problems or projects and ensure smooth hacking on the various problems and ideas.

## Etherpad

The [hackathon Etherpad](https://pad.riseup.net/p/OS3hackathon) is the global whiteboard of the ongoing activities, projects, ideas or open question during the hackathon. This can also help
other people joining the hackathon remotely and willing to discuss with the participants on specific projects. Feel free to update, expand or edit the
etherpad during the hackathon.
