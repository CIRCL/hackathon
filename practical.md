# Date

The hack.lu hackathon 0x4 takes place virtually the 26th and 27th August 2020.

# Location

The event is virtual.

# Registration

No need for registration, everyone can participate. If you want to list your project (released under an open source license and placed in the security field), please send us the logo of your project to [info@hack.lu](mailto:info@hack.lu) to be listed. The only requirements are that your project is:

 - released under an open source license and
 - placed in the security field.

**You don't need to be an already existing member, core member, owner or otherwise linked to an open source project in order to participate to the hackaton. ** The [projects listed](/team) are examples and you're more than welcome to propose other open source projects you would like to work on.

# Core Principles

The hackathon is not a competition, it's an opportunity for open source and free software developers to work together on interesting ideas, projects or collaborations. The goal is to welcome newcomers (and help them to get started) and contributors to the various projets. Code is one aspect of the hackathon but documentation, website, presentation materials, design are also important to open source and free software projects in information security.

# Agenda and Etherpad

As this is a hackathon, there is not a strict agenda to avoid interrupting the work on specific problems or projects and ensure smooth hacking on the various problems and ideas.

## Etherpad

The [hackathon Etherpad](https://hackmd.io/W81vg5n5QEGWAMawu9Ru5g) is the global whiteboard of the ongoing activities, projects, ideas or open question during the hackathon. This can also help other people joining the hackathon remotely and willing to discuss with the participants on specific projects. Feel free to update, expand or edit the etherpad during the hackathon.

## Live chat and video

A [BBB session will be open](https://bbb.secin.lu/b/ale-av7-tk2) for the two days where people can chat and discuss ongoing activities and collaboration.
