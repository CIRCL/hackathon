The 2nd and 3rd May 2017, 40 free and open source software developers meet in Luxembourg to take
part to the first Open Source Security Software Hackathon (OS3 Hackathon). This 2 days event offered
the opportunity to the developers to meet and collaborate on various software projects in the information
security field.

During the hackathon, significant achievements in existing projects were reached along with some new projects started:

- [MISP](http://www.misp.software/2017/05/09/MISP.2.4.73.released.html) and [Cortex](https://github.com/CERT-BDF/Cortex) integration to allow the information sharing platform MISP to connect and use Cortex intelligence services. [Cortex 1.1.1: Two Way MISP Integration Now a Reality](https://blog.thehive-project.org/2017/05/17/cortex-1-1-1-two-way-misp-integration-now-a-reality/).
- [cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search) did a new major release and reorganise the contribution aspect to ease the external contribution.
- [shotovuln](https://github.com/444xxk/shotovuln) - an offensive bash script for pentesters, tries to find generic privesc issue on Unix boxes.
- MISP taxonomy improvement with [assessment of the analysts](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/analyst-assessment/machinetag.json).
- [MISP galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) improved with an extended [ransomware cluster](https://www.misp.software/galaxy.pdf).
- A new project has been evaluated to support the exchange of software vulnerability information within open source projects supporting software evaluation, information security or assessment. The idea is to share a common format between cve-search, [aboutcode](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit) to share information about software vulnerabilities within open source projects.
- Updates in [JSMF-Android](https://github.com/ICC-analysis/JSMF-Android) - Analysis of Inter-Component Communication links (ICC) and source code of Android applications (AST).
- [The Seeker of IOC ](https://github.com/cert-w/certitude) - CERTitude is a Python-based tool which aims at assessing the compromised perimeter during incident response assignments.
- Improvement of [mail_to_misp]( https://github.com/rommelfs/mail_to_misp) with support for Thunderbird added

A second Open Source Security Software Hackathon #2 (19-20 October 2017) will take place after hack.lu conference. Thursday 19th October from 18:00-22:00, a kickoff with all the projects and team
and the Hackathon on Friday. As many speakers and participants to the hack.lu will be there, they can conclude their week by participating to the hackathon.
