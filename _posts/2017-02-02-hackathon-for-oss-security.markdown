<img src="/images/people.jpg" class="fit image">Since 12 years, our team organizes the [hack.lu](https://2016.hack.lu/) security conference, which brings many security professionals together. We observe that many people and organisations create open source software to support their security activities, ranging from reverse engineering, digital forensic, incident response (DFIR), threat analysis to network security. Many of the security tools are developed on a long-term commitment and they provide viable solutions to improve security globally. In order to support the continuity of innovation, development and integration of such open source security tools, we decided to organise a two-days hackathon in May in addition to our yearly hack.lu conference (16th to 19th October 2017).

The hackathon will take place the 2nd and 3rd May 2017 in Luxembourg. Check the [practical details](./practical).

The event is free of charge and open to all projects, developers and contributors (or those who want to become one) who are part of open source projects placed in the security field. You'll be supplied with lunch and drinks.

**You don't need to be an already existing member, core member, owner or otherwise linked to an open source project in order to participate to the hackaton.** The [projects listed](/team) are examples and you're more than welcome to propose other open source projects you would like to work on.
