<img src="/images/people.jpg" class="fit image"> In the past 12 years, we organized the [hack.lu](https://2016.hack.lu/) security conference conference which brings many security professionals together. We saw that many people and organisations create open source software to support their security activities from reverse engineering, digital forensic, incident response (DFIR), threat analysis or network security. Many of the security tools are developed on long-term and provides viable solution to improve security globally. So we decided to organise a two-days hackathon to support the continuity of innovation, development and integration of such open source security tools.

The hackathon will take place the 2nd and 3rd May 2017 in Luxembourg. Check the [practical details](./practical).

The event is free and open to all projects, developers and contributors part of open source projects working in the security field.
